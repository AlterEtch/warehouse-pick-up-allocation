# Warehouse Robot Simulation

This is a simple python project for warehouse robot simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 2.7

### Running the Project
The project can be compiled directly through terminal:
```
python main.py
```
or using any python IDE running the main.py

The number of robots and tasks can be configured through command line arguments, either together or separately:
```
python main.py numOfRobotsAndTasks
```
will randomly generate both robots and tasks in the amount of "numOfRobotsAndTasks", while
```
python main.py numOfRobots numOfTasks
```
will randomly generate robots and tasks in the amount of "numOfRobots" and "numOfTasks" respectively.
